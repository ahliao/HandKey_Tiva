HandKey_Tiva
============

Test of the Tiva Launchpad by creating a 5 button keyboard "glove"

Project Description
===================
Contact-based keyboard using magnets and Hall Effect sensors to determine key id.

Features:
- Mechanical-less buttons for durability (AKA magnets)
- Bluetooth communication for linking to mobile devices
- Other stuff that I need to make up

Milestones:

1. Communication using BT module to PC (Also to be ported to Alectryon codebase)
2. Logging and analysis of Hall Effect data to determine validity of magnet use
3. Breadboard prototype as proof-of-concept
4. PCB design and ordering of components/PCB
5. First version completion
